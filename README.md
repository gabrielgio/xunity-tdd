# xunity-tdd

Chapter by chapter code for [TDD by Kent Beck](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530) for the xUnit Example section, this is just to help to follow that section's chapters, nohting new added.

The only difference is that for that piece of code I'm using Python 3 and snake_case while the book uses Python 2 and camelCase, no big deal
